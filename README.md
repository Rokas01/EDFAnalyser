# EDFAnalyser
EDF Analyser is a tool to read EEG data from edf/edf+ files, annotate elements of interest (epileptic discharges, vertex waves, etc.), save, filter and upload to FTP.

This application was initially developed to aid in detection of EEG spikes common for Benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (also referred as Rolandic epilepsy), however it can be utilized to annotate various EEG elements of interest and exchange data via FTP.

This release utilizes pydedflib library to read and load edf/edf+ files.
